Overview
========

Substra is a framework offering distributed orchestration of machine learning tasks among partners while guaranteeing secure and trustless traceability of all operations.

It supports simple training and evaluation schemes, such as training a model on data in a center A and evaluating the model on data in a center B, or more complex federated learning (FL) schemes, such as Federated Averaging.

Substra has four user interfaces:
    * **Substra**: a low-level Python library (also called SDK). Substra is used to create datasets, algorithms and machine learning tasks on the platform.
    * **Substrafl**: a high-level federated learning Python library. Substrafl is used to run complex federated leraning experiments at scale.
    * a CLI - Command Line Interface
    * a web interface
