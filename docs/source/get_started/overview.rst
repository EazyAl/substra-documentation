Overview
========

Connect is a framework offering distributed orchestration of machine learning tasks among partners while guaranteeing secure and trustless traceability of all operations.

It supports simple training and evaluation schemes, such as training a model on data in a center A and evaluating the model on data in a center B, or more complex federated learning (FL) schemes, such as Federated Averaging. 

Connect has four user interfaces:
    * **Substra**: a low-evel python library (also called SDK). Substra is used to create datasets, algorithms and machine learning tasks on the platform.
    * **Connectlib**: a high-level federated learning python library. Connectlib is used to quickly run complex federated leraning experiments at scale.
    * a CLI - Command Line Interface
    * a web interface
