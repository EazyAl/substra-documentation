Overview
========

Substra is a framework offering distributed orchestration of machine learning tasks among partners while guaranteeing secure and trustless traceability of all operations.

It supports simple training and evaluation schemes, such as training a model on data in a center A and evaluating the model on data in a center B, or more complex federated learning (FL) schemes, such as Federated Averaging. 

Substra has three user interfaces:
    * a python library (also called SDK)
    * a CLI - Command Line Interface 
    * a web interface
