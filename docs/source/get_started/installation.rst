Installation
============

Connectlib and Substra are compatible with Python version 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 on both MacOS and Linux. For Windows users you can use the
`Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_.

To install the command line interface, Connectlib and Substra run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install connectlib

Substra is a dependency of Connectlib, so it will be automatically installed.
