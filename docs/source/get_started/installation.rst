Installation
============

Substrafl and Substra are compatible with Python version 3.8 and 3.9 on both MacOS and Linux. For Windows users you can use the
`Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_.

To install the command line interface, Substrafl and Substra run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install substrafl

Substra is a dependency of Substrafl, so it will be automatically installed.
