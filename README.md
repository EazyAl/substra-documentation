## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this documentation please clone it locally and make a new branch with the suggested changes.

To deploy the documentation locally you will need to install all the necessary requirements which you can find in the 'requirements.txt' file of the root of this repository. You can use pip in your terminal to install it: pip install -r requirements.txt

Next, to build the documentation move to the docs directory: cd docs

And then: make html

The first time you run it or if you updated the examples libary it may take a little longer to build the whole documentation.

Once you are happy with your changes push your branch and make a pull request.

Thank you for helping us improving!
